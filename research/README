To scan a product and get its information inputted in an Angular application, you can follow the steps below:

Install a barcode scanner library or plugin in your Angular application. Some popular libraries include ngx-scanner, ngx-qr-scanner, and zxing.

Create a component or page in your Angular application that will handle the scanning of the product. You can use the built-in camera on a mobile device or a desktop/laptop computer with a webcam.

Initialize the barcode scanner library or plugin in your component or page. This typically involves importing the library, initializing it, and configuring the scanner settings.

Implement a function in your component or page that will handle the scanning of the product. This function will be called when a barcode or QR code is detected by the scanner.

When the function is called, retrieve the scanned code from the scanner and use it to query your database or API for the product information associated with that code.

Display the product information in your Angular application, either on the same page or on a different page or component.

Overall, the process involves setting up the scanner in your Angular application, creating a function to handle the scanning and retrieval of the product information, and then displaying that information in your application.
